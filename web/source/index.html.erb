  Here in the US it's months way from November in the election year. Obviously
  that means only one thing: it's full-on, non-stop presidential election
  season. To help you digest all the political chaos, there is one number you
  need to know: the probability that come November, our country's executive
  branch (and subsequently our whole country) will end up completely and
  utterly fucked.
